# The Game
Terraria is a land of adventure! A land of mystery! A land that's yours to shape, defend, and enjoy. Your options in Terraria are limitless. Are you an action gamer with an itchy trigger finger? A master builder? A collector? An explorer? There's something for everyone.

Start by building basic shelter, then dig for ore and other resources. Discover and craft over 500 weapons of magic, ranged, melee and summon varieties, as well as armor, and use them to battle hundreds of different enemies. Soon you'll be going head-to-head with any of more than 20 enormous bosses. Go fishing, ride a mount, find floating islands, build houses for helpful NPCs, let your creativity run wild and build beautiful buildings, and much, much more.

# Gamemode
On Terraria's title screen, you can pick the game mode you would like to play. For this guide, it is recommended to select "Single Player," and the information presented on this page will assume this is what has been selected. In the case one wants to play with friends, however, select the "Multiplayer" option to connect to other players. On the Old-gen console version Old-gen console and Nintendo 3DS version versions, select Play Game to get started. Note that there is currently no official way to crossplay between any versions.

The Console version Console, Mobile version Mobile, Old-gen console version Old-gen console and Nintendo 3DS version versions have a built-in Tutorial that we recommend completing first.

After selecting the game mode, you'll have to create and select your own character. Click the New button on the bottom right to open the character creation screen. Here, you can change a number of your character's properties, such as: gender, hair, hair color, clothing style along with its colors, skin color, and eye color!

## Name and Difficulty
Your character's name will display when logging into a world, sending messages in chat, and whenever you die. It does not have to be the same as your Steam or console username. On the Desktop version Desktop version, Console version Console version, and Mobile version Mobile version, you are able to change the name of your character at any time you wish. On Old-gen console version Old-gen console and Nintendo 3DS version, your character's name cannot be changed later on.

You can choose different character difficulty options: Journey, Classic (also known as Softcore), Mediumcore, and Hardcore. Note: On Nintendo 3DS version, all players are in Classic mode; there is no difficulty setting.

The character difficulty setting determines what happens when the character dies -- it does not affect any other aspects of gameplay, including how hard the enemies will be.
