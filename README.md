# Guide: Getting started
Welcome to Terraria!

This guide will help you get started on your journey through your world. It will cover gameplay basics like character creation, combat, and early-game tips, and direct you to other guides for further advice. Keep reading for a step-by-step tutorial on how to begin Terraria!

# Gamemode
On Terraria's title screen, you can pick the game mode you would like to play. For this guide, it is recommended to select "Single Player," and the information presented on this page will assume this is what has been selected. In the case one wants to play with friends, however, select the "Multiplayer" option to connect to other players. On the Old-gen console version Old-gen console and Nintendo 3DS version versions, select Play Game to get started. Note that there is currently no official way to crossplay between any versions.

The Console version Console, Mobile version Mobile, Old-gen console version Old-gen console and Nintendo 3DS version versions have a built-in Tutorial that we recommend completing first.

# Character Creation

After selecting the game mode, you'll have to create and select your own character. Click the New button on the bottom right to open the character creation screen. Here, you can change a number of your character's properties, such as: gender, hair, hair color, clothing style along with its colors, skin color, and eye color!

## Name and Difficulty
Your character's name will display when logging into a world, sending messages in chat, and whenever you die. It does not have to be the same as your Steam or console username. On the Desktop version Desktop version, Console version Console version, and Mobile version Mobile version, you are able to change the name of your character at any time you wish. On Old-gen console version Old-gen console and Nintendo 3DS version, your character's name cannot be changed later on.

You can choose different character difficulty options: Journey, Classic (also known as Softcore), Mediumcore, and Hardcore. Note: On Nintendo 3DS version, all players are in Classic mode; there is no difficulty setting.

The character difficulty setting determines what happens when the character dies -- it does not affect any other aspects of gameplay, including how hard the enemies will be.

- Journey Mode gives the player the ability to "research" items and access to various cheat options, like a limited Creative mode. Journey characters can access the cheat menu by pressing C, allowing them to enable Godmode, duplicate items, set the time and weather, Increase or Decrease enemy spawning or Stop Enemy Spawning entirely, etc. Journey characters can also change the difficulty of their world on the fly if they find the current difficulty too hard or easy, and start with an improved set of starter tools and items. However, Journey characters can only enter Journey Mode worlds, including playing in multiplayer.

- - On Console version Console and Mobile version Mobile, the cheat menu is instead located in the pause menu, in the Journey tab. Research and Duplication have their own tabs in the inventory, similar to things such as Equipment or Chests.
- Classic, or Softcore, means that you will drop some of your coins upon death. Depending on world difficulty, you may drop half, 3/4, or all of your coins. Lost coins can be picked up by returning to your death location, but you may have to defeat enemies to get them back.
- Mediumcore means that you will drop every item you are carrying upon death. Dropped items will be permanently lost if you leave the world before recollecting them, and some items can be destroyed by Lava.
- Hardcore means that you have only 1 life, like in Minecraft; if you die, the character file is permanently deleted. Note: Hardcore is not the same thing as Hardmode, which is a game progression term used to indicate a world is post-Wall of Flesh.

# Plants
*For trees growing all across a Terraria world, see Trees.*
Plants are found all across a Terraria world, and may grow from certain block types given various conditions. Most can be harvested for use, and may additionally drop seeds for replanting, such as Jungle grass and Jungle grass seeds. Different biomes generally have distinct plant life.

Plants randomly grow overtime. They also have different growth speed in different layers. See below for details.
